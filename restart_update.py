"""The app's half of "Restart installs a staged update".

The updater on ASAPSV1 stages and health-checks each new release into
``<root>\\data\\staged.json`` — the same directory the app gets as
``COA_DATA_DIR``. When someone clicks Restart and a newer, healthy release is
staged, the app writes ``switch-requested``. The updater does not delete that
file when it acts: it *claims* the request by renaming it into
``switch-accepted`` or ``switch-refused`` (with the reason), so the outcome is
visible to whoever asked instead of silently vanishing. Pickup is usually
≤ 20 s (one supervision tick); the app falls back to an ordinary restart after
``PICKUP_SECONDS`` (60 s) if nothing claims the marker.

The app never touches the junction itself: ``switch`` kills the app's whole
process tree, so a helper the app spawned would die with it.
